- The security parameter $\lambda$ regulates the running times of all algorithms, including the attacker.
	- A typical requirement for all the algorithns is for their running times to be polynomial $\lambda^{O(1)}$ 

# Function Families

A function family is a function $f: K \times X \rightarrow Y$ for some key space $K$, domain $X$ and range $Y$.
- If $\|X\| \gt \|Y\|$ the function compresses it's input (*hash function*)
Some properties are:
- one way
- collision resistant

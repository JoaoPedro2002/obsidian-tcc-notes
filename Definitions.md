# Norm

In mathematics, a **norm** is a function from a real or complex vector space to the non-negative real numbers that behaves in certain ways

## Euclidean Norm

On the $n$-dimensional  Euclidean Space #TODO $\mathbb{R}^n$, the intuitive notion of the length of the vector $x = (x_{i}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}, ..., x_{n})$ is captured by the formula:
$$
\|x\|_{2}:= \sqrt{x_{1}^{2} + ... + x_{n}^{2}}
$$
This gives the ordinary distance from the origin to the point ''$x$''
